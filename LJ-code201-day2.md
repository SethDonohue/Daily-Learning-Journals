## Topics from JS readings, and linter setup:
Linter setup was a bit confusing and didn't really seem to happen as planned, but I think it's working properly. We began to learn the basics of JS. What scripts are, operators, numbers, strings, booleans. All very basic information for now. We learned about the basics of JavaScript (JS) from variables to arrays, naming practices, and how in the future we will link CSS and JS files to the main HTML document.
