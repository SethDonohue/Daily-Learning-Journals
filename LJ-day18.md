#Learning Journal Day 18

# Project Week Day 3!
Today was a bit more rough, but I learned how to softly get people to plan a bit more ahead, especially when we ran into issues. This led to a bit more team development and problem solving skills being used to fix our issues and get back on track.
I learned a ton more about CSS and how to properly control it! And i have become better at organizing my CSS.
