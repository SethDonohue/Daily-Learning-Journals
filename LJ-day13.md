#Learning Journal Day 13

# Class Demos and Lab
Once again, demos were easy.
And today I was finally up to to speed on the current work so I could apply things right after lecture in lab. Luckily that was the case because today in lab i went down a lonnnnng road that didn't lead anywhere after 3 hours. After this I learned the "Shotgun" approach to localStorage, which is not the best practice, but it works. I now understand a better way of storing the necessary data into local storage. I first tried to do it this proper way, but couldn't figure out the proper syntax. Tomorrow I will fix my code.
For now things work, fairly well.
