#Learning Journal Day 19

# Project Week Day 4!
After yesterdays hiccups we are back on track and everything is functioning well! We have MVP and are now just tweaking the look of the site and our output code.
We found some small errors in out output code that were easily fixed.I changed my colors a bit more to make them more appealing/easier to read the black text.
We also did a bit of presentation prep and are thankful that the TA's pulled us into the room to do so!
