#LJ-210-Day8

## Code Review:
 The code review was very helpful today for getting my code cleaner and more functional
## Review lab assignment, code demo, objects, key:value pairs:
Lecture was very clear. adapting it properly to our lab seemed very clear... but something is missing.

I definitely understand constructors way better, and I now have a much better grasp on debugging with the techniques we have up to this point, as well as laying out my plan before smashing on the keyboard to get the codez.
 This is a short journal... my brain is fried and i have a lot more to do!
