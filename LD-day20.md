#Learning Journal Day 20

# Project Week Day 5!
Today was mostly just basic cleanup for our presentation. Not much was learned on our project, but it was good to see the other projects and learn a few things from them.today was good for the future, and talking tho Shami from Zonar was a good start to networking.
We need more speakers like that!
