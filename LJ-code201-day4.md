#LJ-210-Day4

## Code Review:
 We fixed EVERYTHING. It was good to see simple, clear, and concise solutions for the loops we were meant to create, and then even simpler solutions that avoided loops inside of loops.
## CSS and Functions:
Today was a pretty fast overview of some CSS layout, which I have a lot of catching up to do on because i got so hung up on loops on day3 that i didn't even attempt to do much CSS.
I do feel i understand functions fairly well so far and how they handle inputs and return values and how to call them.
Functions evaluate to something and you can pass a function into another function!
##Code Pearing
Pearing was fun, informative and a good way to get new ideas in the mix and troubleshoot things very fast. What took my an hour on my own to think about took 10 minutes with a code partner.

#git skills upgradez
I get git so far, but i think branching will get tricky and I'm having trouble finding the exact terminal commands to use, but we haven;t covered it yet, so I'll wait and see what the proper commands are to use.
