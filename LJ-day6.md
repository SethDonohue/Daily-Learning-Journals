## Code Review:
 The functions and calling the array indexes and even having the functions nested was the easiest part of the course so far for me. it just clicked.

## Review lab assignment, code demo, objects, key:value pairs:
Today I was able to follow along in the lecture, but for some reason it took a long time for things to click during lab. It turns out i wasn't doing the calling correctly and was one "node" away from the correct call with "this." or contextualness missing from a key statement. Once i got that down i figured out the rest much faster, but it was still a struggle overall. I chose to have two render statements because the way i calculated my random numbers I needed to reference the first render function to calculate the total. Now that I think about it with afresh mind in the morning i could probably pass the calc function into the main render function.
