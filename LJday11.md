# Learning Journal Day 11

# Class Demos and Lab
The lab and class demos all made sense today and were fairly easy to follow along with, but I had a serious hiccup making things work in lab. I had a decent map of what I needed to do and got 3 random images to work and to change when clicked, but past that I got stuck. I tried to follow what some other classmates were doing, but this just wasn't my Monday and definitely my most lost lab.I am having trouble with the eventlisteners for some reason. I referred back to our salmon-cookies project, but don't seem to be able to reconcile the difference between that and our busmall lab. Tuesday will be a steep Learning curve. I'll be asking a ton of questions today...
