#LJ-210-Day10

## Code Review:
I spent most of the code review fixing my JS, but I got it to work!
##CSS Lab
The guided technique was very helpful. Following Sam's methods for setting up the DOM and then very orderly going from top to bottom to add content and then top to bottom to add CSS was a very useful way to to it, and an obvious way to do it. It helped greatly in the lab for pear programming and we got the lab almost completely done!
## Review lab assignment, code demo, objects, key:value pairs:
Matt and I worked well together, split up the HTML in half, combined it through git, then I navigated as he drove for the CSS coding. It went fast and better than expected and we got the page to look close to what the boss expected.
The techniques we used will definitely be useful for this weekend when I have to redo all of my CSS!
