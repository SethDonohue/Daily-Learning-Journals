#Learning Journal Day 16

# Project Week Starts!
This week had been useful to get some soft skills refreshed on team work, team agreement stuff, and just general cooperation. This is definitely, imho, the most important part of the class because this is the closest to the real work environment most of us will get until our first jobs.

Yesterday I learned quite a bit more about CSS:
 ".body > div > a" Direct child calling, CSS animations, hovering, shadows, key frames, color themes.
 Hopefully i'll have a much more appealing site by the ned of the day!
