#Learning Journal Day 15

# Class Demos and Lab
Demo was useful for Catherine and I so we knew how to properly make the shopping cart.

I definitely didn't have enough time Thursday to come up with a good idea for the final project which is frustrating.

I learned a bit more about array methods, but it will still be something I will have to look up often to use properly.

We got a good start on the group project, and hopefully the team moves well together.

I'll definitely learn a fair amount about CSS and the project should be useful for a portfolio item, especially if it is improved.
