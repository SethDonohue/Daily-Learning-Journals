#Learning Journal Day 17

# Project Week Day 2!
Day to went smoothly for the most part. I attempted to get the team a bit more organized so we can get MVP, but got some pushback that "we'll figure that out tomorrow or the end of the day today". Then when we tried to figure it out it wasn't working as thought. So day 18 is MVP day.

We all got our basic templates working, but the tricky will be how we output the code...
